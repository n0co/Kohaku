# Kohaku
Python Scraper built off googlesearch python

Runs a google search, google dorking is supported, and individually performs GET requests to each site and parses for a specific word or term that you are looking for. 
Puts results and errors/400s to separate files and appends the links, so that you can view it later. 

Recommend the "kohaku_switches_revised" file due to it being CLI based and faster. Some bug fixes as well
